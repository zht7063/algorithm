# algorithms

Repo to record my algorithm titles' resolutions. (mainly from LeetCode)

Note: for convience, This repo uses uv to manage python environment, as for C++, it's can directly run by g++ or gcc on Linux, so I just prepare a folder for C++ code, and the C++ code can be run directly.

---

Personly, recommand to add an alias for g++ to compile and run C++ files.
